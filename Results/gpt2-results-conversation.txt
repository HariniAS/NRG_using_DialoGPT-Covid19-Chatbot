User: Then there is the cytokine storm to contend with, an overreaction of the immune system which causes serious inflammation.
Chatbot: In the last few weeks, there has been a lot of reports that the COVID-19 virus has been causing a lot more of the virus. So that could be the cause of the pneumonia.

User: New habits shocked no one else has answered this question. 

I am worried about after we get out of stay at home orders. I am worried how they will know it is over. With that being said i think i will be mindful of how i feel more and avoid my family who are high risk if even the smallest sx.

User: Recent news says people are moving away from using their phones and more to their laptops (as tracked by the big sites, their mobile traffic is down and their website traffic is up). It's attributed to people being home not mobile, (the article said people are realizing they don't like  "squinting at their tiny screens.") It might not be a lasting habit after the virus ends, because mobility outweighs being able to see details on a screen, but it might affect the way phones are designed in the future.

User: My new habit is to read more. I am a person who doesn't like to read so I'm trying to start reading some books or blogs. Can anyone recommend me some blogs or books?
Chatbot: I have a self diagnosed condition and I am not really sure if I should read more than one book or just read one book. I have been reading a lot of short, short, and short stories. I also have a very high fever and a slight cough. I would like to know if I can get better.

User: Nobody knows because of the lack of testing.  A lot of people have it without being aware of it.  People have it for awhile before they notice symptoms.  Different people have different levels of sickness, just as with any other illness.  At some point if we really want to know the answer to this we're going to have to test pretty much everyone for the disease and for the development of antibodies for the disease, but that isn't happening and isn't likely to happen.  Very very low percentages of people are getting tested, especially in the US.  China didn't test as much as you'd think either, they went mainly by symptoms because they were so overwhelmed.  What will probably happen over time is, the disease will calm down thanks to social distancing, fewer people will have it, and scientists will be able to then do controlled studies to answer these kinds of questions.  But if you have no idea how many people have it then you can't judge everyone who got it and how quickly they got over it.

User: Update: Since the structure of coronavirus is similar to that of HIV to some extent, HIV ARV medication - Kaletra, which is a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir is seen to be helpful in curing people from the effects of COVID-19 infection.

Kaletra is a protease inhibitors, it blocks the protease enzyme, a key enzyme that helps the virus to replicate. Previous studies had found that the drug combination was helpful in preventing SARS, also a coronavirus, from maturing and replicating.

User: Oh that's interesting about the meds. I heard someone mention antivirals for treatment, but I think of antivirals as Valtrex, as in herpes treatment, not ARV (antiretrovirals, for those who don't know), but I may have misheard or he misspoke. ARVs are notoriously expensive, though. It will be interesting to see how that plays out here in the US. Good info. Thanks, Mike.
Chatbot: No. It is not. It has to be a viral infection.    The virus is transmitted through the virus.  The person who is infected is the virus is not the person who has the virus, but is infected.  If the person has the infection, the virus will spread.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?

User: I also heard that the drug for Malaria Chloroquine has had some effectiveness in treating Covid19. It is lessening the symptoms of serious cases.

User: You know, nothing is a dumb question right now and we're all anxious and worried!  I understand your concern.  There is mixed messaging on surface contamination and groceries.  This seems to transfer easiest through the air which would be droplets someone coughs, sneezes or spews through speaking into the air.  I would not think droplets would be in the air of the bag.  Perhaps some droplets were left on the bags themselves but that goes back to surface contamination.  Touching it.  The person who delivered the groceries didn't have the bag on their head.  :>)  So, I in all honesty think you are all good.  Wash your hands!  We can only control so much in life.  Being in a hot spot is scary.  I am sorry we are all going through this!

User: There are fewer contractors running power equipment every day on perfectly fine yards and homes owned by people who seem to just have too much money to spend.  My neighborhood used to nice and quiet until the County decided it should be a much wealthier neighborhood and allowed developers free rein to tear down perfectly fine small house and build massive houses that took all the lovingly raised foliage people had planted over many many years and tore it down.  The people who moved in are constantly hiring people with the loudest imaginable equipment to work on them and that has been cut down considerably due to social distancing, so there's one positive story for me at least.

User: Depending on where you are, it would probably be difficult to get a test for Covid-19 based on just a sore throat. Other viruses are circulating that give sore throats, and on lists of symptoms of Covid-19, the most common is a fever and after that a cough. Sore throat is not very high on the list. If you are in a country where it is easy to get tested, go ahead, but if not, they will probably tell you that you don't match the profile of Covid-19 and won't test you.

User: That stinks.  I know that I had throat just as this was starting and it really worried me!  Remember that there can be a lot of issues going on right now, regular old viruses and colds.  If you have no fever or cough, I would just continue to shelter at home.  Gargle with salt water, take acetaminophen and hydrate well.  Get rest.  I think the advice I've read a lot is that you should act 'as if' you have it to protect others.  But it is doubtful that you do or if you do, this is just a mild case of it.   I'd do what you can to minimize spreading it to anyone else (just as you would any other virus) and wash hands as often as you can or use hand sanitizer of 60% alcohol, wipe down what you can, etc.  I personally would not risk leaving your home right now to test if you only have a sore throat.  The places you go to test can be hotbeds in themselves.  You are managing well it sounds.

Chatbot: I have a mask and a mask that I have been using for over a year now. I have a fever and I am having a hard time breathing. I am not feeling good and I have had a fever for the past two days. I also have a sore throat and I feel like I am getting sick. I feel tired and I don t feel well.

User: My wife and I were avoiding them because that was the official advice, that they didn't work for healthy people, only for the sick, and to leave them for the health professionals.  Then they changed the advice and my wife ordered some and they haven't arrived yet.  Don't like the idea, but I guess we're going to wear whatever she ordered online to the grocery store.  Don't go anywhere else anymore, though, no place to go, and you don't need them to exercise outdoors as there's plenty of room to avoid others.  It seems that since so many who have it are completely asymptomatic we may be spreading it without knowing it.  So I guess it's masks for all now.

User: The reason you need to stay 7 feet from humans is not just because of their potential to cough Covid 7 feet onto you. Measles coughs can travel 37 feet because it is a small virus but Covid is heavy and can't go so far because of the spiky exterior that is so useful for it to attach to surfaces and infect us. When you pronounce the F and G sounds saliva is also spit out of your mouth, so keep your 7 feet distance even if they aren't coughing.

User: My city is at a complete lockdown for 21 days as of now, all local transport, shops, organisation and institutes are shut sparing the daily supply outlets only. Local law athorities have been very strict about not negotiating with any one wandering with out a good reason. I go out around my home, almost daily, for once to get groceries and necessary supplies as I don't want to hoard anything. I am being very cautious, I carry a sanitiser in my car and wash my hand at all times. I even got my workout bench and dumbbells home from my warehouse to ensure not stepping out of home for sometime, I was missing my workout for a week, I had to fix this as it was making me a bit unhappy. 

I am usually not an anxious person or have issues with OCD. However, I must admit, I got a bit scared from an event lately, I met a friend on 20th March and she sat next to me in my car, we were trying to do some catching up, she told me that her dad returned from Dubai that morning and was advised home quarantine, I didn't think much about it until she left and I went home. I got a bit worried later that day when I read that a lot of people returning from Dubai to India got infected, I checked my temperature quite often for the last couple of days. I just realised I was being a bit anxious! 

Considering the population of my country, which off-course is the second largest in the world, our government is trying all possible measures and means to combat any undesirable situation, there are huge quarantine centers being deployed, ventilator arrangements are being made. At this point the official number of people infected is at about 700 but these numbers can go up drastically, if we get to stage 3, community infections are popping up slowly :(

How Long Does Coronavirus Stay on Clothes and Laundry?

By Debbie Koenig

April 5, 2020 -- Many emergency room workers remove their clothes as soon as they get home -- some before they even enter. Does that mean you should worry about COVID-19 transmission from your own clothing, towels, and other textiles?

While researchers found that the virus can remain on some surfaces for up to 72 hours, the study didn't include fabric. "So far, evidence suggests that it's harder to catch the virus from a soft surface (such as fabric) than it is from frequently touched hard surfaces like elevator buttons or door handles," wrote Lisa Maragakis, MD, senior director of infection prevention at the Johns Hopkins Health System.

There's more, but that's the gist.

User: There are a lot of reasons for this.  For one, a lot of people are getting tests that are incorrectly administered.  This is apparently especially prevalent at drive through testing sites, especially ones where the person getting tested is told to do the swab themselves but can also happen when the person doing the testing has to reach through a car window.  The problem is that the swab has to go pretty far up into the area to get a good sample.  So that's one problem.  But we also have to consider that there are a lot of false positives and false negatives in lots of diagnostic testing, most people just aren't paying as much attention as they are to this particular disease because it's all we're hearing about and it's so affected all of our lives even if we don't have the disease.  For example, there's a colon cancer test you see advertised on TV that has about 10-20% false positives.  The whole purpose of developing the test was for those who were too scared to get a colonoscopy, but this test pretty much guarantees that a lot of unnecessary colonoscopies will be done because if you test positive that's the next step.  While false negatives are definitely bad, false positives are also bad, because they result in unnecessary treatments.  Medicine is much less accurate than most of us believe it is so it shouldn't come as that big a surprise that this disease with all the urgency we're all putting into it would suffer from the same problems.
Chatbot: Thanks for the whole the test.

User: Probably everything has potential for false negatives.  And false positives. But if you are sick and get a negative, you are still sick and isolation is still important to protect other people.  Looking forward to the antibody test that is coming.
Chatbot: Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I have a question about the virus. What do you think should be done?

User: Dr. Sarfaraz Munshi, urgent care lead at Queen's Hospital in London, has shared breathing exercises to help people struggling with COVID-19.
"Once you have an active infection you need to be getting a good amount of air into the base of your lungs," the doctor says. "I want you guys to start doing this if you have the infection right from the beginning. If you want to do it before you have an infection, good idea."
Here's his simple, three-step technique.
1. Take five deep breaths in, each time holding the breath for five seconds.
2. On the sixth deep breath, take it in and do a big cough (cover your mouth, of course).
3. Do two cycles of the above and the lay flat on your front (on a bed, ideally) taking slightly deeper "normal" breaths for the next 10 minutes.
"You've got to understand the majority of your lung is on your back not on your front," he adds. "So by laying on your back your closing off more of the smaller airways and this is not good during the period of infection."
Chatbot: !!!Thanks for your welcome to the medical advice.

User: Not from eating the pineapple. For one thing, pineapple is wet and extremely acid. I have seen nothing that says a stray bit of corona virus would land on an acidic, wet surface and stay viable. For another, SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes Covid-19) is not a stomach virus.  You don't get the illness from eating the virus, but from breathing it in.

If you had, for example, wiped some virus molecules off the sack and then rubbed them into your eye or stuck them up your nose, there is a slight possibility, though from packaging is not the way most people get Covid-19. But it sounds like you did nothing like that anyway. You've got to get the virus into your respiratory system in order to get Covid-19.

User: Unless it was on some dust, that risk of airborne seems unlikely. Covid spiky shape you have seen is useful for it to attach to surfaces (although it doesn't have a brain to make decisions so it's just circumstantial) which makes it so easily transmitted. Lots of research needs to be done so we have to wait for the experts to provide definitive answers to questions like this. Until then, multiple scientists are checking out their theories. No one knows what the minimum viral load would have to be either, as far as i can tell.
Chatbot: !!!?!!,!!'!!Hello!!:!!’!!Hi!!Remind me!!Thanks!!Hey!!I!!This!!Will!!Hope!!My!!Work!!

User: The way the virus could get on something is via sneeze droplets, or aerosolized virus that floats in the air. If there had been sneeze droplets on the packaging, by the time it was in your trash it would be too late for any virus to be viable. And aerosolized  virus doesn't come from pushing on packaging and having a rush of air in your face, it happens only in special circumstances (can happen when someone is in the hospital and being intubated, for example). From what I've read, even forceful sneezing doesn't have enough force to aerosolize the virus. (You could google how long the virus can live on packaging and how infectious it is after it's been sitting on paper or cardboard. But even when they find the virus when they look on surfaces, it's questionable how long it remains  viable.) 

The virus is so new that there are just a lot of unknowns. Other countries' experiences suggest that while Covid-19 is contagious, it is not like the most contagious illnesses (measles, for example, can spread like wildfire among people who have no protection). So, wash your hands and stay 6 feet away from others like they say, but try not to be so worried that you stress over every little thing.
Chatbot: !!!’!!!!!Hello!!Thanks for your question!!Regards!!

User: No, it isn't. 

It's spread through saliva droplets or when someone sneezes or coughs.

User: I saw a report from someone who had Covid-19 in which he had the loss of smell and taste, but only about halfway into the illness. A lot of reports include it as a symptom but say it is sort of a harbinger. In this guy's case, it happened after he already knew he was sick.
Chatbot: Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. I have no idea if the disease is caused by the virus. I would like to know if I can be tested for Covid 19.

User: It has been reported in several countries and a UK study 2 weeks ago, but most government websites don't mention it yet as a symptom to watch out for. You can google lots of articles about olfactory symptoms and loss of taste a few days after the smell sense is lost. the UK study said it was the first symptom for some but new data comes out daily so all I do is sniff the coffee each morning then smile.

User: Of course first the person wearing the mask has to have the virus -- most people wearing masks don't have the virus, they're just wearing masks because it makes them feel safer (I've heard mixed opinions on whether masks are at all useful for the healthy.  Medical professionals seem to discourage it because it's one of the main reasons for the shortage of masks for health professionals.  They say if you have the virus a mask does help prevent the dissemination of the virus from coughing or sneezing, but unless you have a respirator mask an ordinary surgical mask of the sort most people are wearing doesn't actually prevent breathing in these particles very well so they're not very effective.  But Chinese officials say they are necessary.)  As for the rest, I guess theoretically if all atmospheric conditions are just right to get the flow from a sneeze or cough right to where you are standing and the mask is unsuccessful for some reason in stopping wide dissemination of particles, then maybe.  Doesn't sound like something worth worrying about, though.

User: Anyone can die or develop permanent health issues, if they become infected. 
You will remain safe if you can maintain social distancing of 7 feet (because even pronouncing the letters G and F make people spit) and wash with soap frequently or use disinfectant wipes.

User: Thx dear , smoking and drink alcohols how infecting the body of infected people ?
Chatbot: Not at all. You are not a virus. You have a virus in your body that is infecting people. You will be fine.

User: Hello.   Good question.  So, you never know if you will end up being someone that has complications with Covid 19 but there is definitely a riskier group.  Those with significant underlying conditions.  Cardiovascular disease and hyper tension are amongst those.  Your BP is elevated.  Let me ask you, is this the usual number or a one off reading?  Do you typically have hypertension?  And do you treat it?  Are you on medicine?  Exercise clearance from your doctor?  Would be important to be doing all of those things very faithfully right now.  You also are not old but older.  

I think I would do as they are suggesting and socially distance.  No extra trips out and be vigilient about hygeine.  Wipe things down, use hand sanitizer of 60% alcohol or more, do not touch your face, avoid anyone coughing, etc.  Heck, try not to leave your house or have guests over for the time being if you can help it!  We all are doing that.  

Now those that die of covid-19 seem to have SiGNIFICANT underlying factors.  You may have some things going on but are not likely fully in that category.  But I do understand you are worried and it's time to distance and be proactively careful.

Chatbot: Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I have been in contact with someone who has been in touch with me. I can understand your concern. Would you like to video or text chat with me?

User: Sorry you aren't feeling well  The thing is, right now no one knows for sure unless they take a test.  You don't have the hallmark signs of cough and fever though.  That makes it more unlikely that you have the corona virus.  However, I'm looking forward to the antibody test that may shed some light on things further.  We all don't follow the typical pattern.  So, no one can say for sure until you've had your antibodies tested.  But you are out of the woods in terms of your breathing?  Do they suggest a nebulizer at home?  Any rescue inhalers?  Anything you can do?  

heart burn is known for causing some chest pain at times.  It has been mistaken for a heart attack.  Does this sound like what is going on? https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325019  You did the right thing to get checked out as you don't want to ignore chest pain and tightness.  Remember that shortness of breath involves oxygenation and the symptoms are not just chest tightness although that can be present.
Chatbot: !!!Thanks for your question.!!Hello and Welcome to Healthcare Magic.!’!!‘!!Welcome to Healthcare.!Welcome.’’

User: Can you be infected? Yes. Given the fact that it is highly infectious. 

The question is are you infected? You might be, only if you are displaying relevant symptoms. Below are a few common ones FYI:
-cough
-fever
-tiredness
-difficulty breathing (severe cases)

If either of the above listed has been your complain in the 14 days from the date of exposure, you need to isolate yourself from others. 80% of the infected population recover with out any special treatment. In case your symptoms get adverse, reach out to a doctor immediately.

If you didn't exhibit any of them, you are fine. Stay away from such excursions at this point. Since you are in India, the government has imposed a lockdown. Therefore, you need to stay at home now.
Chatbot: !!!Thanks!!

User: No one is guaranteed immunity from this disease and there are no proven cures or vaccines today. Some age groups fare better than others but anyone over the age of 1 can die, so constant washing with soap or disinfection wipes along with social distancing to avoid contracting it are the only ways to guarantee that you will be safe.

User: The news mentioned this last week - https://www.nbc12.com/2020/03/21/study-says-your-blood-type-could-make-you-more-susceptible-coronavirus/

"New research shows your blood type may make you more susceptible to catching coronavirus. The study published in Wuhan, China compared blood types in 2,173 people in Wuhan and Shenzhen with COVID-19 to more than 3,600 healthy people in the same areas.

It showed people with type A blood are more likely to catch the virus and die from it. People with type O blood may be less likely to get COVID-19.

"If you are type A, there is no need to panic. It does not mean you will be infected 100 percent," researcher Gao Yingdai told the South China Morning Post. "If you are type O, it does not mean you are absolutely safe, either. You still need to wash your hands and follow the guidelines issued by authorities.""

So you might be less likely with type O, but you still are definitely able to get it.
Chatbot: !!!Thanks for your query.!!Thank you have solved your question.!’!!‘!!'!!Regards!!,!!Hello!!.!Regard!!Translation!!Remindeed to further!!

User: Hmmm - I should probably be careful, huh?  I wonder if it matters if one is Rh positive/negative and where Type B, AB, etc falls into the mix. 

On another note, I also read that men seem to be more susceptible to getting, and dying from, the virus than women, but they don't know exactly why yet.  There may be several reasons, including lifestyles, hormones, etc.

"Previous research, including by Klein, has revealed that men have lower innate antiviral immune responses to a range of infections including hepatitis C and HIV. Studies in mice suggest that this may also be true for coronaviruses, though Covid-19 specifically has not been studied.

“Their immune system may not initiate an appropriate response when it initially sees the virus,” Klein said.

Hormones can also play a role – oestrogen has been shown to increase antiviral responses of immune cells. And many genes that regulate the immune system are encoded on the X chromosome (of which men have one, and women have two) and so it is possible that some genes involved in the immune response are more active in women than in men.

Sex differences in the immune response to Covid-19 are likely to show up in antibody surveys that are currently under way across the world. Klein said she has already reviewed papers on this from Chinese teams, who have tracked blood samples from patients over the course of infection. “We can expect more on this soon,” she said.

Ultimately, Hawkes said, biology, lifestyle and behaviour are all likely to play a role."

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/men-are-much-more-likely-to-die-from-coronavirus-but-why

I think they're going to be learning a lot about this virus for a long time. 

All that said, as noted - none of us is safe, so be sure to wash your hands  and have a good day...   :-)
Chatbot: !!!Thanks for your query to you have reviewed the virus-!!Regards.

User: This is interesting.  Years ago when I was a health food store manager there was a craze about eating and exercising and everything else based on your blood type.  Some research was done by a nutritionist, but it was picked up and run away with in a bestselling book by a naturopath who made a fortune selling all kinds of things based on your blood type.  The argument was that blood type in part determined what foods you could digest and which your body might fight as invaders, and was extended to all manner of things we do and consume.  It became such a craze we were selling kits by the tons so people could check their blood types, as at least back then doctors didn't order this as part of the blood tests they request.  I assume this fad disappeared because I don't see any products in health food stores now sold by your blood type.  But I wouldn't take this too seriously, because the vast majority of humans are type O, the universal donor.  AB is fairly rare.  So given how many people are getting it, just by numbers alone most of them have to be Type O, and the other types are probably more overrepresented rather than being the majority of cases.

(not elevated).  The gasping for air you describe almost sounds like a symptom of a panic attack.  I am SO glad that you went and had an x ray of your lung and that they are clear.  I have read what this shortness of breath is said to feel like.  Kind of like drowning.  Which sounds beyond dismal.  It's not just not being able to catch your breath.  I'd not hesitate to be seen and tested though if this continues.  But I must agree that this sounds more like anxiety than covid 19.  I hope it gets better.  It's a very stressful time and I feel for you.

User: Is she working long hours?  Most people in the medical industry are these days, and what they are seeing isn't for the faint of heart.  The CDC website has the symptoms of the virus on it and bloodshot eyes aren't one of them.  If she does work in a care facility, she has been well briefed by now on what to look for, and given how overburdened our outrageously unprepared system is to handle this I'd defer to her on this.  Now, if she gets a fever and starts coughing and has trouble breathing, that's a different story.

User: You know, whenever one of my kids are going to get sick, I usually know.  Their eyes show it first.  They just always 'look sick' and we call it sick eyes.  So, I understand what you are saying.  However, here is the good news.  Your mom works in health care/ care home.  Is this like a nursing home?  If so, I would imagine they are taking her temperature before she enters.  They are worried about what is brought INTO those patients as they are more vulnerable.  So, they are monitoring her.  Since she has COPD, that's a respiratory disorder that may make her more vulnerable and how old is she? If she is at higher risk, perhaps a leave of absence would be best or make sure she is doing everything possible to protect herself.

Blood shot eyes on their own don't mean much of anything related this.  If she shows any symptoms at all, the rule where I live is to assume you have it and isolate.  The hallmark signs are cough, fever and possibly shortness of breath.  I would avoid going to the doctor if you can help it for anything right now until this eases up as you know . . . that's where all the sick people are going.  So, it's going to be a risky endeavor.  Most doctors ARE taking phone calls and also providing telemedicine. So, if she begins to cough (usually a dry cough) or develops a fever, call right away.

User: Hi.  I know, it's a scary time.  I find myself analyzing all of my aches and pains and this and that!  It's a very nerve wrecking time.  I think just a pain in your throat that doesn't materialize into anything else is likely just a sore throat.  :>)  No coughing or fever developing is a good sign.  The covid 19 does seem to have a progressive nature so after 4 to 5 days, if nothing more is happening, that's great.  Drink some hot tea, gargle with salt water, and if you can, you can take acetaminophen or ibuprofen for pain relief.  Some with covid 19 have reported a sore throat but it's not one of the hallmark signs.  I do think many have it but not that alone as far as I've read.  Here is a symptom pdf from the CDC that compares common flu, cold and corona.   https://www.health.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/2020/03/coronavirus-covid-19-identifying-the-symptoms.pdf

User: Gosh, sorry to hear you are not feeling well!!!  And I completely understand that right now, all illnesses are scary.  They do have a pretty good chart out right now of how to tell symptoms apart.  One thing that I have noticed on all of the charts is that runny noses, stuffed noses, etc. are more indicative of a cold.  There are upper respiratory infections and lower respiratory infections. Colds are upper and Corona virus is lower.  The hallmarks of the corona virus are dry cough, fever and shortness of breath.  I do read a lot that people also may start with a sore throat.  But sneezing and a lot of nose activity is more of a cold symptom.  Regardless, your symptoms would be mild if you have the virus and we are all supposed to act like we have it and stay away from others.  So, do that if you can.  :>)  Here's that chart on symptoms.   https://www.health.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/2020/03/coronavirus-covid-19-identifying-the-symptoms.pdf

Do you live alone?
There will be many fatalities but if you are careful to not touch your face, plus if no one coughs on you then you will likely also be enjoying a brighter day in future. Try to become ambidextrous so you touch doors, elevator buttons etc with your left because that way your right hand will not be infectious when you inevitably touch your face by accident. You still have to keep washing and sanitizing your right because sometimes you will touch something else with your right, but learning to become ambi for every movement except head touching requires concentration so it will be mentally challenging which might help break the anxiety focus.
Depression and anxiety go hand in hand in a vicious circle feeding off each other while ramping up the pressure on the victim, so it is important to seek ways to break out from their grip if you find that too much of your day is consumed by those 2. Perhaps learning a new ambi "skill" will lead to some interesting anatomical  puzzles to solve, such as unlocking your door while balancing groceries in the same hand.

User: I know this is making me feel very anxious internally.  I feel an impending doom which I don't know if it is because of the sixth sense or if it is because doom is coming.  lol  But it is very uncomfortable.  I am trying to take a little bit of every day to do exactly what I want to (at home).  Watch a dumb tv show, play an online card game, read my celebrity trash magazines, etc.  Just a time to not think about anything else.  

Agree that is a good tip on being ambidextrous.  I also used my elbow to push a door open and to push an elevator button.  

Also, cell phones.  I keep thinking I'm the only one touching it and I am not going to give corona virus to myself . . . but they do recommend careful cleaning of it.

User: One thing to keep in mind is that stress and anxiety can take a serious toll on your immune system.  So, ironically, worrying excessively and allowing thoughts about the virus, and what could happen, makes you more susceptible to contracting, and having a harder time fighting, any disease.  The added stress of parents newly working from home, and kids being home due to school closures, doesn't help.

Anyone who finds themselves having panicked or doomsday thoughts about themselves or loved ones related to the possibility of contracting the virus, or experiencing a lot of stress due to household changes, should absolutely have a talk with their doctor.  Medication, even if temporary, may be helpful to get anxiety under control.

User: As for anxiety, I have waves of it that come and go during the day and when I first wake up. I wake up and feel anxious. I play games on the phone or listen to music and try to calm my breathing. It is hard. I am not sleeping as well. One thing that is particularly bothering me is that I have to pick up a prescription, that is controlled, for my migraine variant. I cannot just go off of it or I will get very sick, such as seizures, etc. So the pharmacy won't guarantee that I get my refill if I do mail order. So I have to go  in next week and I hope I don't get it from someone at the pharmacy. I have written twice to the doctor. We are in shutdown in California, and so we are not working and so the threat is getting high here. I listened to a Kaiser Permanente healthcare lecture on Corona virus and the expert said that it is going up 2.5 times every 5 days here. So that means if we have 100 infections today 5 days will be 250, 5 days more 625, 5 more days 1563 etc. Until we stay in long enough to "flatten the curve". Then the cases will slow and we can maybe not have to stay home. But it looks to me like it will go up to the point where we will get lockdown. We don't have enough hospital beds here for the ill so they are converting the hotels and other places into makeshift hospitals. We are trying to delay the spread of it to health care workers and to ourselves until we get a treatment. I have read that Chloroquine plus Azithromycin may be somewhat effective in lowering the severity of the disease. Also some new antibody based treatments are being worked on. There is a lot to think about. My husband is staying home from work for the first time. He is 64 and so it is also different having him home. We both have to adjust to that too. I hope we get a good treatment and of course vaccine soon. Peace and love to all of you.

User: I'm not particularly worried myself. But I can't help wonder how much emotional and psychological damage is being done by all the lockdowns that are preventing people from paying rent and mortgages and all the rest. The whole tidal wave of "better safe than sorry" and "flatten the curve" doesn't care about those people one bit. They're just shrugged off, and hardly appear in the media at all. Collateral damage.

Many or most restaurants and clothing stores might be dead forever. Who in their right mind would want to own one now, knowing they can be closed at will? Pet stores, on and on. 

What happens if one worker in a supermarket gets ill, then all the others have to take 2 weeks at home just in case because they were in the same room as the sick one?

You've been diagnosed with mild COPD. Since you can't control covid19, focus on what you can control, which is quitting smoking. It's HARD, but it's possible. Find the way that works best for you. It might be cold turkey, it might be weaning off them, it might be with aids like nicotine gum or something.

User: Smoking ravaged not only my family but the entire post-WWII generation (many of whom got hooked by the free cigarettes given out by the carton to everyone involved in that war, not only those in uniform but also those who provided support to them.  Combined with the extreme pollution we face in our water, air and food from our industrial society, while it's unusual to get this from smoking so young I'd consider myself lucky.  My Dad spent the last ten years of his life unable to walk more than a block.  My Mom died of cancer at age 55.  My sister died of a blood clot at age 48.  All chain smokers, and my sister was also obese.  So if you're overweight (you said out of shape), smoke that much starting at an age when your body hadn't fully developed yet, and you're already getting these kinds of problems, it's time to quit smoking now.  Trust me, this isn't the way you want to go.  It's long, slow and really painful.  I don't mean to scare you, but there's so much you really can't control in life, such as Covid, but smoking you can.  It's not easy, but you can.  So if that's the cause, you can fix it.  As for the copd, I'm not sure that the doctors really know you have that.  If it's a mild case, I'm not sure how they would differentiate that from so many other things that could affect the lungs, such as allergies et.  It could be food allergies or intolerances catching up to you as well, such as to dairy.  But anything you get in that area combined with the smoking is more than you want to handle.  My brother never smoked, but he got ashthma because of our parents' smoking and now that he's over 70 he has copd.  I've had allergies all my life, and learned they were caused by my parents' smoking when I moved out of the house at age 17 and a lot of my problems stopped, but not all of them.  Quitting isn't easy, but it's easier when you have a real scary reason to, and now you do, and you're young enough to do it.  Peace.

User: There is no proven method of prevention other than washing your hands and social distancing from everyone.

DE won't act as a sterilant for your lungs and no one will ever study it for that purpose. Toxicity. Acute: harmful by inhalation in high concentrations which can cause inebriation, sedation, unconsciousness and respiratory paralysis. Diethyl ether is irritating to the respiratory system but these effects are usually reversible on removal of exposure.
Chatbot: !!!?!!

User: I would certainly agree with ANM.  This possibly fatal idea might have gotten started because of valid speculation that the ether might kill virus when used as an anaesthetic in a hospital. (Patients on ventilators might get anaesthetized to keep them from overbreathing when on a ventilator, which would harm their lungs.) It's not for amateur administration.

Remember Michael Jackson? Plus, there's possible explosion :)

I have some heart issues, and I'm taking greater risk, since no one can tell me for sure what risk level I have. I'm not in congestive heart failure or anything, but no one really knows, so I'm acting as if I'm high risk, just in case.

User: "Am I at greater risk of developing severe illness should I be infected?"

Hi, Arturo; this is my rough interpretation:
Because of your valve problem, with every beat there is some backflow of blood and so there is reduced blood flow going out. On top of that, by itself getting CoViD can make anybody's heart muscle perform less well; and so that also causes a reduced blood flow going out. Your total reduction of outgoing blood flow can therefore be greater than if you didn't have the valve problem.


Let's see what the American cardiologist group says about ordinary flu:
"Acute viral infections have three categories of short-term effects on the cardiovascular system:
...
    Second, myocardial depression leading to heart failure.
..."
from https://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/articles/2020/03/01/08/42/feature-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-provides-potent-reminder-of-the-risk-of-infectious-agents

"Myocardial depression" means the heart muscle isn't working so good. In sepsis from the CoV infection, the flood of inflammatory chemicals are involved in that. "Heart failure" means not pumping out enough blood. But the "failure" presumably can be temporary if heart muscle is not permanently damaged. However, the effect can still be devastating in the short term.


None of that, though, tells you HOW MUCH greater risk there is for you.

User: This is not a normal flu virus and I would say everyone should fear its effects on you and any loved one you can easily accidentally pass it on to. A google search will reveal many articles stating that Iran has many young deaths, including a 23 year old from the National soccer team so I imagine she would have also considered herself healthy before she got it. It would be a bad idea to eat with others, IMO because if you google Italy coronavirus you can see how bad it can be. I'm waiting this out being as safe as possible, because if you get infected within the next month you may not be able to get in a hospital. 
Around 40% of Covid hospitalization in the US are 20 - 54, so if hospitals get overloaded, it's anyone's guess what the protocol will be to determine who is going to be turned back? 
Something like 10% of SARS survivors who were hospitalized have permanent pulmonary damage and heart damage so bad they require monitoring forever, so there are even more issues to fear than the death rate. 
The thread below shows how easy it is to get infected from surfaces so I would not want to be in someone else's house especially since if they invited you over they are likely not being careful to protect themselves.

User: Hi, In my reading and what I have seen so far they are saying mostly >65 or
those with diabetes, heart problems, lung problems, low immunity due to illness of some sort or being on chemotherapy, having other immune problems are the high risk group. anyone over 50 I have seen has some lowered immunity because as you age your immune system starts to go down.
Hope this helps. I hope the best for us all.

User: Listen to your kids and limit your activities to those that allow social distancing. Dinner at your friends' houses don't allow that. You can't know for sure if they have been exposed somehow. 

People over 60 are at risk, and that includes you. Yes, younger people are at higher risk than originally thought, so you can tell your kids the same things they are telling you. My mom is telling me to stay at home, but she's just now finally doing the same. 

Take care of you.

User: Interesting article about this 204 patient study. "Seven of the patients in the study had digestive symptoms but no respiratory symptoms." so I wonder why they even tested them to discover they had Covid.
Chatbot: No need to be so specific. Covid 19 is not a known cause of COVID-19. Covide 19 is more likely to be the cause of the respiratory symptoms.

User: Usually you don't have sinus issues with Covid19. So it may be related to food or your Hepatitis. If you don't get worse you should be okay.

User: auntiejessi: FWIW, from what I've seen around, the most recommended OTC is vitamin D. I'm not talking about health food blogger types. I'm referring to various actual doctors who have reviewed the limited evidence. Surprisingly to me, moderate to low doses daily seem to work better than high doses occasionally, and even better than high doses daily.

Btw, this might be just a small issue but since WHO warns against paper money, the mail might be in the same boat.

If you scroll down to Figure 1 you see the course is pretty much the same in survivors vs non, except for the onset of organ injuries (presumably mostly from hypoxemia from the ARDS, plus coagulopathy) in the non-survivors.

User: I don't think there is much known for sure about how to improve the system, because it is a system and has so many unknown interactions that might be required to maintain a fine balance. I read in Harvard Health that it seems logical that if you take probiotics that it would be a good idea but that is just a theory, and in fact your immune system might perform worse if you increase one facet of it because it may require a balance that you are throwing off. They said just sleeping properly was the best thing you can do but that was a 2014 article. You can still google it today if interested.
Lots of nutrition health research has been contradicted by later studies so I'm thinking we will not know the answer for years because nutrition and human bodies are so complex. I don't think Vitamin C has been proven useful other than to prevent scurvy so it would be pretty hard to be deficient in C today.

User: Hello Specialmom, it's been a while. If you live an average healthy lifestyle and have no underlying health issues, you will be fine. It's us older and sickly that are at risk. Don't get caught up in all the hype and use common sense. I saw on one report that a mild to average case of the flu is stronger than the Corona Virus. This is why it's mostly the weak that fall prey to it. I read yesterday, only 2 small children died in China. It's good to see you again.

User: All I keep seeing is how many infected and how many died but no one is providing the numbers of people who have recovered! Although I did see one stat that said 98% recovery rate. But I don't trust ANY source at this point because I feel like there's way too much misinformation out there to know what's true and what's false. So we're all just sitting here waiting for the other shoe to drop and see what happens in the coming days and weeks.

User: The symptoms are Dry cough, Fever, and shortness of breath. Most people are stating that it starts with a dry cough that doesnt produce mucos. I know me I have had a cough and headache issues for over two weeks now. However, I always have allergy issues right around this time of year. Therefore, I am not concern. I would say if you dont have fever nothing to rush out and be checked for. Be cautious though if needed and get checked.
Chatbot: !!!?!!

User: I also get allergies when the weather changes - congestion, headaches, etc. 

One key thing between covid and a cold is a fever. If you have a fever, call your local health dept or your doctor - whatever the protocols are for the area you're in.
Chatbot: !!!Translation :!!?!!,!!Thanks!!’!!Hello!!Hi!!I!!Stay safe!!

User: Check out this World Health Organization (WHO) site.  It's got a lot of information, including a list of symptoms that include, cough, fever, nasal congestion, runny nose, aches/pains, sore throat, diarrhea.  Although some of them may be mild and not everyone will get all of the symptoms.  

It's quite likely you have a cold, but if you've been around someone who may be have tested positive for COVID-19, you should talk to your doctor about getting tested.

User: It can, but it doesn't typically.  https://www.healthline.com/health-news/flu-allergies-coronavirus-different-symptoms SOB (shortness of breath, for those reading who don't know) isn't usually as severe with the flu as it is with covid19. If you or someone you know is experiencing SOB, you should contact your doctor promptly. If the shortness of breath is making you or someone else really struggle to breathe, you should contact 911 or your local emergency number. Let them know that you may have covid19, but not being able to breathe is a medical emergency.

User: Gosh, I'm sorry you went through that.  I'm very happy you survived though as I lost my mom when she was only 52 years old to sepsis.  That experience probably was pretty terrifying and you don't won't to repeat with a near death experience over corona virus!  From what I've read, you need to make sure your diabetes continues to be under control.  Got enough medicine?  Make sure you have maybe a little extra.  We don't want to stress the system and 'hoard' it but at the same time, if anything happens to the supply chain, you are high risk so do not want to be without. I'd give your doctor a call.  I would absolutely follow every precaution because even controlled, having diabetes is a risk factor for a bad outcome with covid 19 and you want to be safe.

User: Do you have any remaining issues from the sepsis or lung issues? 

If you don't, you are probably not at additional higher risk because of that. Can you make an appt with your doctor - any doctor you have? - and get a consult to see what they think?

I know it's scary. I'm high risk, too. Hang in there. 

In any case, you're staying at home with the rest of us, and are taking care of your diabetes, which is awesome.

User: One of the deaths in my state was a 14 year old.  I know that is an outlier but would not want to risk my children!  I thought this was an easy to read article from the New York Times that is answers to questions parents may have:
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/09/parenting/coronavirus-parents-need-to-know.html

Should we be taking our kids to parks?  Well, to run around on their own, yes.  But not to play on the equipment or interact with others. The virus can survive on metal, glass and other surfaces you may find at the park playground. 

Can you make your own hand sanitizer for your kids?  This article says you can try but to get enough alcohol is hard as it has to be at least 60%.

If your kiddo is sick, as many would be at this time of year regardless of corona, do you take them to the doctor?  Avoid it if at all possible. If they have trouble breathing at all or can't drink, then yes, get help right away. 

While kids are out of school, if old enough, get them in on the laundry business and have them wash their sheets and bedding more often.

Chatbot: Hello, I have been diagnosed with pneumonia and I am in contact with someone who has been in contact since March. I am currently on antibiotics and I have had a fever since March and have been in touch with a doctor who has treated my husband since March, and I do not feel any improvement. Is there any way I can get tested?
